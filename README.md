### Hi there, Welcome to my GitHub Profile. 

My name is Siraj and I am a Fullstack Web Developer thanks to [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/). A self-motivated developer with a strong interest in developing exceptional products and a constant desire to improve my skills and knowledge, transitioning from a background as a Civil Engineering Technologist.

- Iâ€™m currently learning Tailwindcss, Azure, Angular, and TypeScript
- I'm committed to expanding my skillset in the future by learning Vue, Python, and Java
